## Developer Roles & Folder Ownership
- **Developer 1 (Windows 10):** Owns `/image-processing/`
- **Developer 2 (macOS M4):** Owns `/discord/`
- **Shared Modules:** Go in `/shared/`

**No developer should edit files in another’s folder without coordination.**

## Branch Naming
- Use feature branches: `feature/<task>-win10` or `feature/<task>-m4`

## Collaboration Rules
- Coordinate before editing another dev’s folder
- Commit only to your feature branch or shared modules
- Keep all code modular and OS-agnostic
